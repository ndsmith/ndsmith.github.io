Although my primary academic interests lie elsewhere, I've always had an interest in technology. I think a lot about technology, its nature, ethical implications, and impact on society.

I've decided to put some of this thinking into a series of blog posts. I call it Terms of Service. I plan to post something new about once a week for the next few weeks. My intention is that they will be short and easy to read. Hopefully non-academics as well as academics might find something useful.

I'll leave this post up as a sort of Table of Contents for the series. I'll edit it with links to the various articles as they are finished.
