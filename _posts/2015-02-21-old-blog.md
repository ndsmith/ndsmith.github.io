Broken links are a problem. Unfortunately, my website reset has generated a fair few. That's because my old Wordpress blog used to be the home for this domain name.

I thought about migrating the blog posts, and maybe I still will. But I like the idea of a fresh start. So for now I will leave them be.

My old blog posts are still there. You can find them [at my old site](https://nathanaelsmith.wordpress.com/).
