My dissertation proposal is complete. I'm actively putting together my dissertation committee and working on the paperwork for A.B.D. (all but dissertation) status. It's off to the races.

The topic of my dissertation is the epistemology of ideology. It's a topic that fascinates me and one which I think has real import, both theoretically and for society. What is ideology? Are ideologies the sorts of things that can be justified? If so, then are any of them actually justified? What role do ideologies play in justifying other beliefs? These are the questions (among others) which will be my primary occupation in the coming year.
