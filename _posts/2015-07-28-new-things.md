Much has happened since my last post. I've started a working with the [Seward Family Papers Project](http://humanities.lib.rochester.edu/mellondh/research/seward-family-project/) at the University of Rochester. The project aims to digitize and transcribe the remarkable collection of letters written by the members of the Seward family. The central figure, [William Henry Seward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Seward), was a politician and served as Governor of New York as well as Secretary of State during Abraham Lincoln's presidency. 

Additionally, the [Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship in the Digital Humanities](http://humanities.lib.rochester.edu/mellondh/) has officially commenced. I am really looking forward to discovering more about digital methods, their use in other disciplines, and their applications to philosophical research. Right now, I'm especially interested in learning more about any DH work being done in philosophy, so if you are a philosopher working in DH drop me a line and tell me about your work!
