One year. Not an ideal amount of time to pass between blog posts. But here we are.

The year has not been boring. In addition to all that has happened in my personal life (a subject for another post), I have shifted toward philosophical pragmatism. I started moving in this direction in my first master's degree. So it has been a long time coming. But I'm still not sure what sort of pragmatism I want to endorse. Many of the details are, therefore, forthcoming. 

So this post has a dual function: a reassurance that I continue onward and (when possible) upward. Another, a promissory note for more to come.
