<p class="body"> My work is primarily in epistemology, although I'm also interested in issues in metaphysics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of science. Presently, I am starting work on a dissertation focused on the epistemology of ideology. I plan to investigate the nature of ideological beliefs, how they are formed, how they change, and whether they are justified. </p>

<p class="body"> Additionally, I developed an interest in the digital humanities during my tenure as an Andrew W. Mellon Graduate Fellow in the Digital Humanities. Of particular interest to me are the ways that philosophy might benefit from digital methods.
