<p class="body"> My work is primarily in epistemology, although my interests range into metaphysics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of science. Presently, I am in the early stages of a dissertation on the epistemology of ideology. I plan to investigate the nature of ideological beliefs, how they are formed, how they change, and whether they are justified. </p>
