<p class="body">In 2015, I had the privilege of working on the <a href="https://www.sewardproject.org"> Seward Family Digital Archive</a>. This project, spearheaded by <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/his/people/faculty/slaughter_thomas/index.html" target="blank">Prof. Thomas Slaughter</a>, seeks to digitize and transcribe the extensive correspondence of the Seward family. The most famous Seward, William Henry, served President Abraham Lincoln as Secretary of State. </p>

<p class="body">During my time with the project, I served as the Data Manager. The role involved three main tasks.</p>

<p class="body"> First, I oversaw the digitization process. This involved coordinating with the Project Manager and the staff at the <a href="https://www.library.rochester.edu/rbscp" target="blank"> University of Rochester's Rare Books and Special Collections Library</a> in selecting letters for digitization. Selected letters were then photographed, catalogued, tagged with meta-data, and distributed to other members of the project for transcription.</p>

<p class="body"> I oversaw a small team of undergraduates who were the primary photographers. I then renamed the digital image files, imported them into the project's Adobe Lightroom catalog, and tagged them with metadata. </p>

<p class="body">My second task involved the management of the image catalog, ensuring its forward compatibility, security, and organization.</p>

<p class="body">Finally, I participated in the work of reading and transcribing the letters themselves. The transcriptions were then tagged to enable cross-referencing persons, locations, and literary works as they were mentioned in the letters.</p>
