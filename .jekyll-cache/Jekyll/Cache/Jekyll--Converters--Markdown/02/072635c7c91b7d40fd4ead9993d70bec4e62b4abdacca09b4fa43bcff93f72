I"À<p>Broken links are a problem. Unfortunately, my website reset has generated a fair few. Thatâ€™s because my old Wordpress blog used to be the home for this domain name.</p>

<p>I thought about migrating the blog posts, and maybe I still will. But I like the idea of a fresh start. So for now I will leave them be.</p>

<p>My old blog posts are still there. You can find them <a href="https://nathanaelsmith.wordpress.com/">at my old site</a>.</p>
