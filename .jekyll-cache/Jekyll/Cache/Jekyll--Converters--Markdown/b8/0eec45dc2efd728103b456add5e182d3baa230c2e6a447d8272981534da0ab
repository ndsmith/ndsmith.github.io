I"´<p>There is a <em>lot</em> of data on the internetâ€”and the data is growing. Here are a few facts Iâ€™ve collected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Facebook has, on average, 890 million active users per day (<a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/">source</a>).</li>
  <li>On average, there are 70 million photos posted to Instagram per day (<a href="https://instagram.com/press/">source</a>).</li>
  <li>There are more than 300 hours of video uploaded to YouTube <em>every minute</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html">source</a>).</li>
  <li>There are 500 million new tweets per day on Twitter (<a href="https://about.twitter.com/company">source</a>).</li>
  <li>In 2014, there were an average of 1.83 million public photos uploaded to Flickr every day (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/franckmichel/6855169886/">source</a>).</li>
  <li>As of May 2014, Pinterest had 30 billion pins (<a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/05/pinterest-is-sneaking-up-on-twitter-and-facebook.html">source</a>).</li>
  <li>In February 2015, Wordpress.com had 61.6 million new posts (thatâ€™s roughly 25 posts <em>per second</em>) and 6.7 million new pages (<a href="https://wordpress.com/activity/posting/">source</a>). This doesnâ€™t count sites running Wordpress CMS which are hosted by other services. And by one estimate, there are just as many of those sites as those which are hosted by Wordpress.com (<a href="https://managewp.com/14-surprising-statistics-about-wordpress-usage">source</a>).</li>
  <li>The numbers for Wordpress.com donâ€™t include any of the sites running Wordpress.orgâ€™s CMS while being hosted by other services. Wordpress powered sites not hosted by Wordpress.com</li>
  <li>Back in 2008, Google announced that it had processed 1 trillion unique URLsâ€”and that was 7 years ago (<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/we-knew-web-was-big.html">source</a>).</li>
  <li>According to websitemagazine.com, Google had indexed 200 terabytes of data as of 2014 (<a href="http://www.websitemagazine.com/content/blogs/posts/archive/2014/07/22/do-you-know-how-big-the-internet-really-is-infographic.aspx">source</a>).</li>
  <li>In February 2015, Netcraft.com registered more than 883 million different websites (<a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2015/02/24/february-2015-web-server-survey.html">source</a>).</li>
  <li>And, in case you were wondering, reports that the internet is mostly porn have been greatly exaggerated (<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-23030090">source</a>).</li>
  <li>Here is a nice little infographic summing up the per minute data generation as of 2012 for a variety of websites (<a href="http://www.domo.com/blog/2012/06/how-much-data-is-created-every-minute/?dkw=socf3">source</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>This volume of data generates a host of interesting questions for the philosopher. I plan to reflect on a few of these issues in future posts, so stay tuned!</p>
