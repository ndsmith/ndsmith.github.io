I"ê<p>I have pulled the plug on my Wordpress.com blog-turned-website and have moved to a new platform. I wanted my site to be thoroughly customizable and as cheap as possible to maintain. Additionally, I wanted to explore how well I could handle HTML and CSS. Behold, the result!</p>

<p>My site is now hosted (for free!) by <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and runs on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. In the next week or so I will transfer over the domain name as well. I‚Äôm new to coding HTML, CSS, and Liquid, so some features of the site might be ugly or buggy until I get the hang of things. Thanks for being patient!</p>
