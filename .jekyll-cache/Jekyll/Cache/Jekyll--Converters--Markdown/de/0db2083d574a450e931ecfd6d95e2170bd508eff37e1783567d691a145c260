I"y<p>One year. Not an ideal amount of time to pass between blog posts. But here we are.</p>

<p>The year has not been boring. In addition to all that has happened in my personal life (a subject for another post), I have shifted toward philosophical pragmatism. I started moving in this direction in my first master’s degree. So it has been a long time coming. But I’m still not sure what sort of pragmatism I want to endorse. Many of the details are, therefore, forthcoming.</p>

<p>So this post has a dual function: a reassurance that I continue onward and (when possible) upward. Another, a promissory note for more to come.</p>
